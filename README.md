# Rush Hour: Slide Puzzle Game

Welcome to the **Rush Hour** slide puzzle game! The goal is simple but the challenge is real — **slide the red car out through the exit** by moving the blocking vehicles out of its way. No lifting, no shortcuts — just brain-teasing fun!

## How to Play

### The Objective

Free the **Red Car** (usually the bright red or yellow car depending on your version) by sliding it through the exit on the edge of the grid.

##  Setup

1. **Choose a Challenge Card**
   Pick one of the puzzle cards and place the vehicles on the traffic grid **exactly** as shown.

2. **Position the Vehicles**
   Place all cars and trucks on the board in the positions indicated by the card.


##  Gameplay

* **Slide** the cars and trucks **only within their lanes**:

  * **Up and down** for vertically-oriented vehicles
  * **Left and right** for horizontally-oriented vehicles
* **Do not lift** the pieces off the board — all moves must be sliding only.
* **Keep vehicles in their lanes** — they can't turn or rotate.


##  Rules

* No lifting or removing vehicles from the board.
* No moving vehicles outside their designated lanes.
* Only one goal: **clear a path for the Red Car to exit** the grid.


## Stuck?

* No worries! Just **dump out the pieces and reset** the puzzle using the challenge card.
* If you're really stuck, **flip the challenge card** — the **complete move sequence solution** is printed on the back.


## Tips

* Think several moves ahead.
* Try moving different vehicles to open new paths.
* Practice makes perfect — start from beginner levels and work your way up!
